  <h5>JUST JERUSALEM 2050 URBAN DESIGN | <span style="font-size : 14px">Conceptual Urban Design</h5>
   <div> 
    
     <p class="projectSection">Background</p> 
     <p style="font-size:12px"> Jerusalem 2050 is a unique visionary and problem-solving project jointly sponsored by MIT's Department of Urban Studies & Planning and the Center for International Studies. By bringing together Palestinian and Israeli scholars, activists, business leaders, youth, and others, it seeks to understand what it would take to make Jerusalem, a city also known as Al Quds, claimed by two nations and central to three religions, a place of diversity and peace in which contending ideas and citizenries can co-exist in benign, yet creative, ways. </p>

     <p style="font-size:12px"> In order to break out of the stalemate that has reinforced the cycle of despair and conflict in Jerusalem and largely removed questions of urban livability from the public discourse, the Jerusalem 2050 project aims to bypass the standard route of negotiation between "representative" peoples and turn instead to the liberating potential of imagination and design. Rather than aiming for unity or synthesis among competing parties in their plans for the city, we will encourage the production of bold and “non-negotiated” visions for Jerusalem, with the assumption being that only through such methods can there emerge a shared understanding of the basic urban conditions necessary for a tolerant and culturally vibrant city to flower, independent of ethnic or religious partisanship. Another goal of this project is to promote the use of design and other creative imaginings of space as techniques for arriving at a more positive social, political and economic organization of the city. </p>

<!--   <ul>
   <li> The potential of the entire area to establish smooth relationship witht eh urban character and the fragmented structure in the vincinity</li>
   <li>The programs with which it is equpped with as a public space, its flexiblity to allow momentary/spontaneous activities; thus its potential to host diverse and unplanned events</li>
   <li>Organization of open areas and their relationship with the coast and the dense urban fabric in the background</li>
   <li>Whether there is a memorable image of the entire area and the relationship of that image with the Historical Peninsula as a whole</li>
  </ul> -->


  <p class="projectSection">Framework</p> 
  <p style="font-size: 12px">Jerusalem 2050: Vision for a Place of Peace seeks to open new windows of understanding - from within the region and around the world - about the shared hopes, dreams, and desires of citizens from Jerusalem who want to make their city peaceful, but who have been prevented from doing so because the aims of competing national states to control this particular territory have pushed urban livability concerns off the agenda. Jerusalem 2050 was conceived in response to the deteriorating situation in the city (from the occupation of East Jerusalem to the building of the wall to the accelerating and ongoing violence) and the failures of Track I and Track II diplomacy, the latter of which may partly owe to the great inequality in power balances among the negotiating parties. As a strategy for generating peace and understanding, this project differs from conventional approaches in several ways. 
By focusing on the city, not nations, it emphasized the uniquely tolerant and cosmopolitan character of the urban experience. It encouraged imagination and vision, not the real politics of negotiation and political trade-offs. It proceeded under the premise that when given an opportunity to voice their desires and dreams about the city, that most citizens - be they Muslims, Christians, or Jews, Palestinians or Israelis, residents or not - are likely to find common ground and share similar sentiments about what might make the city of Jerusalem a vibrant, peaceful, tolerant and democratic place. This project does not aim to be a ‘solution' for the city, but rather, to provide imaginative tools which open alternative, innovative ways for discussing and eventually dealing with urban and political conflict.

<p class="projectSection">Our team design proposal: Healing Jerusalem: Decrypting the Urban DNA with a metaphor of Cell Model </p>
<p style="font-size: 10px"> Teammates: Gökçe Gerekli , Sevgi Yücesan, Müge Durusu, Behiye Gürevin</p>

<p style="font-size:12px; text-decoration: underline">Conceptual Study and Design Ideas:</p>
 <p style="font-size: 12px">To go down deep into the essence of Jerusalem requires the examination of her anatomy with a scientific point of departure. The cell model; a convenient metaphor for the diagnosis and the treatment of the anomalies that Jerusalem is facing today. 
</p>

<p style="font-size: 12px">The Old City: The nucleus, the spatial container of the hereditary material, of the urban DNA. The extending urban fabric: The cytoplasm, which does not communicate well enough with the Old City, which does not host the functions that are vital to the sustainability of the life cycle. The cell membrane: Not coherent, the definition of the boundaries is lost with the fast urban sprawl. The hereditary material existent in the urban DNA and visible in the Old City, thus, can not be “transcripted” and “translated” into the new city. The current situation is one that can lead to “apoptosis”, the death of the cell. 
 </p>

<p style="font-size: 12px">The cell has a life cycle. It is born, it lives, and it is dead. </p>

  <ul style="font-size: 12px">
   <li>Birth of the Cell: Beginnings of Existence The birth of the city is similar to the birth of the cell, coded by its DNA. The nucleus of the city stores the necessary energy in itself that can be used for the transformation of the city.</li>
   <li>Life of the Cell: Jerusalem before and after political, spatial and religious interventions Split of the cell into two without the duplication of the DNA – East Jerusalem’s loss of its memory Loss of collective identity –alienation </li>
   <li>Death of the Cell: Today and the inevitable future if Jerusalem is not healed If the cell is not isolated from the exterior interventions in the correct time, the nucleus dissolves, destroying both itself and the whole cell. </li>
  </ul>

  <p style="font-size: 12px">The “Shell of Life” has multi-dimensions both in space and in symbol. Vertically, it represents the different temporal layers of the city, and adds a new layer to all the stratification beginning from the Bronze Age, and this new layer is the contemporary layer. Horizontally, it embraces the city like a spider’s web, only setting its feet on the ground whenever it finds a convenient open space or a function to flourish. Thus, in the places where it touches the ground; it becomes spatial, where it is not; it sweeps as an idea carrying the past, the present and the future of the city in itself. One structure to be; Alive, Connective, Just, One, Peaceful, Respectful, and Unifying.</p>
