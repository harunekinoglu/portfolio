     <p style="font-size:8px"> Conceptual Taxi Design from this project</p>
  </div>
  <p class="projectSection">Background</p>
  <p style="font-size: 12px">In parallel with the urban developments of Istanbul as a healthy and safe city, taxi vehicles, taxi stands, and communication systems gained more importance as the major components of the taxicab system of Istanbul. In 2011, Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality Urban Design department launched an international industrial design competition to find the design ideas for the taxi of tomorrow for Istanbul which can provide a more comfortable service to the public and which are equipped with ergonomic, technologically advanced accessories, high security and safety measures that can meet the needs of the disabled, and its principles.</p>

    <p style="font-size: 12px">In order to achieve this goal through a creative design competition process, the relevant authorities of the city have defined four sub-themes that crate the taxi system and three designer profiles (High School Teams, College Teams, and Professional Designers Teams) who will develop design ideas for the four design themes.</p>

    <ul style="font-size: 12px" >
         <li>General-purpose taxi,</li>
         <li>"Eco-car" for controlled and restricted areas (protected areas, world heritage sites, historical sites, parks, tools limited to traffic and controlled outdoor areas, and so on ...) for "eco-car."</li>
         <li>Taxi rank (service points) species</li>
         <li>Taxi communication systems</li>
    </ul>
  <p class="projectSection">Design Process</p>
  <div class="container">
   <div  class="row">
    <div  class="col">
  <ul style="font-size:12px">
    <li>Through a well-programmed participatory design process developed by a team in my lead, we created a highly diverse selection committee that involved all the relevant stakeholders for the jury. They help to provide transportation knowledge and advice which can help to synchronize people's ideas.</li>
    <li>For finding the next generation taxi design ideas for Istanbul through competition(people's involvement and participation), an online voting system has been developed for the website of the competition to make citizens decisions effective in the final decision-making process.</li>
    <li>My key and critical position at the management was about being responsible for conceiving and process managing of the “Design Competition for Istanbul’s Taxi System” for the complete re-architecture, deployment, and management of Istanbul’s new generation taxi system. This kind of management focus started from conducting the R&D process for developing the industrialization program to the way Istanbul’s taxi customers will interact with their new taxi system. Following this research, I have developed the design brief for the contestant designers to design an entirely new city taxi vehicle for Istanbul.</li>
    <li>Later on, following the competition, I was also responsible for overseeing the development of the rules/regulations for what is, in essence, Istanbul’s ‘Taxi of Tomorrow” to develop the standards of taxi service in Istanbul.</li>
    <li>The competition web site received 1,5 million clicks during the two weeks online public voting for the design proposals. 340597 votes determined the winning design proposals.</li>
