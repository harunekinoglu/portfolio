       One of my most recent professional achievements is about Istanbul’s candidacy for “UNESCO Creative Cities Program – City of Design." I managed the design and development of Istanbul’s candidacy including mission statements, urban design programs and the entire application package.

      <br>
      To achieve this success, I programmed and managed the flow of meetings, guest lectures, and research in a broad range of fields concerning Istanbul’s creative profile which involved designers, professionals and representatives from local governments, NGOs, academia, relevant public & private sectors, and culture & art institutions. On October 31st 2017, UNESCO announced that Istanbul has been entitled as “UNESCO City of Design”. This experience has cultivated my design thinking and problem-solving mindset and skills. Overcoming obstacles such as limited time, constraints about resources, I’ve improved my ability in seeing the complex procedural and bureaucratic issues from different perspectives; to convert creative city theories into new urban development and local empowerment solutions and programs for Istanbul.

<p class="projectSection">Mission</p>
 <p style="font-size:12px">Spanning two continents, İstanbul is a city of encounters, transitions, and interactions. Its 8,500-year history has bequeathed it a multi-layered cultural heritage that serves as a rich source for traditional arts and crafts, and an inspiration for innovative design ideas. At once antique and dynamic, multicultural Istanbul is an ecosystem of creativity and sharing where new experiences are brought to life and old ones passed on to new generations. Today, with a population of over 14 million, it is one of the largest cities in the world. It accounts for 23% of Turkey’s GNP and 40% of the national budget. According to 2014 data, 52.4% of those working in Turkey’s creative sector live in Istanbul, and the city accounts for 74.5% of the country’s total financing in the sector. Istanbul is the only city in the world that offers direct flights to 302 points of 299 cities in 120 countries. The city hosts international art, film, theater, music festivals, and art and design biennials. Named as the European Capital of Culture in 2010, and served three terms as the President city between 2010-2016 it is a member of United Cities and Local Governments (UCLG).
<br> 
Istanbul’s cultural heritage is an inspiration for the design sector and a significant advantage of the city’s productive capacity. Istanbul utilizes both to promote a unique design identity and synergy between design and local industries. Modern design has a keen interest in tradition, and Istanbul is replete with local craftspeople who are masters ('USTA') of their age-old arts. Turkey has long promoted such fields at the individual, local, and national level, with a focus on preserving crafts by fostering master-apprentice relationships, research, and ties between the traditional and the modern. Paired with design, traditional crafts can answer modern needs and promote local and societal wellbeing. A pillar of sustainable development, design can address local problems, provide jobs, and promote cultural development. It can also encourage new ways of thinking, preserve existing cultural identities, and promote a city’s cultural identity. Research and development in goods and services with a high value-added and support for design and innovation offer some positive returns for the city, especially regarding promoting social well-being and a happy and peaceful social life.<br>

<p style="font-size:12px">The Istanbul Creative City Platform (ICCP) is the governance mechanism for Istanbul’s three main Design City initiatives: a “Master ('USTA') & Designer” program, a “Documentation” program, and the establishment of an “Istanbul Design and Innovation Center” (IDIC). An Advisory Board will work together with the Board of Directors, and the two will hold joint meetings to ensure proper coordination, evaluate candidate projects, and monitor active projects. The project coordinators who work wth the project owners and project groups will also be part of the organization and governance body. Its administrative address will be at the ITA office until the opening of the IDIC.<br>
The stakeholders for all projects and programs coordinated under the structure of ICCP include all design actors, from professional groups, academics, and craftspeople to designers and innovation-research organizations.

<p style="font-size:12px">One of the programs that will be undertaken by the Istanbul Creative Platform (ICCP) within the framework of Istanbul’s designation as the Cityo of Design will be the establishment of the Istanbul Design and Innovation Center (IDIC) <br>
The IDIC will be a hub for the Design City programs and stakeholders and provide a venue, replete with the necessary technological infrastructure, for engineers and industrial designers to come together in multidisciplinary workgroups to develop projects. It will promote the visibility of young designers and encourage dialogue to aid in setting priorities, identifying problems, and developing coordinated action plans to boost innovation.<br>
The IDIC will also host an annual international design conference.

<p style="font-size:12px">The ‘’Usta (Master) & Designer’’ program is one of those programs that the city commits to undertake within the frame work its designation as the Unesco City of Design. The programme, that will be coordinated by the Istanbul Creative City Platform (ICCP) aims to bring masters of traditional crafts and designers together to achieve a meeting of craft and design and create opportunities for young people interested in design to experience the master-apprentice relationship, and thus to contribute to the transfer of knowledge. Thus, in the longer term, it aims at raising the economic potential of traditional crafts by raising awareness about them.<br>
ICCP Boards of Directors and Advisors will support the sustainability of the relevant programmes and projects as well as documenting and archieving the outcomes of the related researchs and practices on that topic in order to share with international network through possible collaborations and various media channels.

The program will be carried out in partnership with the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality’s Big Data Center and will benefit from its technological storage infrastructure. The Istanbul Creative City Platform (ICCP) will be the governance mechanism for the programme.
